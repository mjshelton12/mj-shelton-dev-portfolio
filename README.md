## Summary

* Built components for header, nav-bar, core content, and footer
* Built components for those components including socials, projects, pages, about, portfolio, contact, and resume
* Built data to populate each section, allowing quick updates as developer only needs to edit the data to change the content rather than go into each component to make changes 
* Created look of the site with CSS and made it reactive to be viewed on different sized screens
