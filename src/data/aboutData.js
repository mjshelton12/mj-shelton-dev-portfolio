After realizing this skill had developed into a passion, MJ enrolled in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp so she could take her technical skills to a new level across industries. Friendly, driven, and a creative problem-solver, MJ loves to be a part of a team working hard to create an efficient, effective project.'
