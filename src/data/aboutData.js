Thanks to creative problem solving (and a little Googling), MJ found herself frequently playing in-house tech-support as she taught herself how to manage computers, set-up digital filing systems, and recognize software error messages. After realizing this skill had developed into a passion, MJ enrolled in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp so she could take her technical skills to a new level across industries. Friendly, creative, and driven, MJ loves to be a part of a team working hard to create an efficient, effective project.'}
